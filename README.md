Create HTML for the Ebay Description HTML editor to add better formatting and colours

Whilst listing a product on ebay I noticed that the webbased Desciption editor was lacking some basic functoinality like changing text colours, ordered lists and text alignment.
The text editor does however allow you to enter raw HTML in another tab of the editor.

So I created a basic web text editor with some of these lacking features which generates raw HTML from its entered text. The raw HTML can now be simply entered into ebays editor to produce the desired text and formatting.
